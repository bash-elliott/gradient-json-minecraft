# gradient-json-minecraft
Python script that generates a Minecraft json string with a linear gradient between two hex codes.

## ⚠️ ARCHIVED ⚠️
This is an old version of the Gradient JSON Generator. The new repository managed by [ElGeroIngles](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles) contains more features and is more recently updated.

**The new repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ElGeroIngles/json-multiple-gradients).**

## Usage
Download the repository and open the python file inside. The file automatically closes after printing the ending string, so make sure you open it in an existing terminal.

**Text:** The string to make into a gradient.

**Color A:** The first colour of the gradient as a hexcode. The gradient is generated left to right, so this will be the leftmost colour. The # is optional.

**Color B:** The second colour of the gradient as a hexcode. The rightmost colour. The # is optional.

**Bold?:** Bold text? Any input other than _true_ (case sensitive) will be considered false.

**Underline?:** Underlined text? Any input other than _true_ (case sensitive) will be considered false.

**Italics?:** Italic text? Any input other than _true_ (case sensitive) will be considered false.

### Output

The program will print a long string of text that you can then paste into any tellraw command or other command that accepts JSON.
